## How it works

* A configurable joint is connected to a [world-constrained](https://github.com/VRLabs/World-Constraint) kinematic rigidbody and given velocity on the Z-axis.
* The joint has collision and stops against the world.
* A particle system under the joint dies with collision, causing a [particle stop action disable](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ParticleSystemStopAction.html), triggering a contact-driven parameter change.

## Install guide

https://github.com/VRLabs/Rigidbody-Launcher/assets/76777936/9f288264-7a4b-4790-b6c3-38a1180a3ea5

* Merge the Animator Controller ``Rigidbody Launcher FX`` to your own FX Controller, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.
* Drag & drop the ``Rigidbody Launcher`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* Move ``Rigidbody Launcher Target`` outside of ``Rigidbody Launcher`` and place it anywhere in your avatar's hierarchy. Adjust the transforms as needed.

## How to use

* Place the objects you want to to use inside ``Rigidbody Launcher`` -> ``Container``.
  * Alternatively you can constrain the objects to ``Container``.
* ``RigidbodyLauncher/Control`` parameter must be true for the system to fire, and false to reset.
* To change speed, you can edit the ``Launcher Fire.anim`` animation clip and change the ``Target Velocity``. You need to use a negative value.
  * You can also change the ``Maximum Force`` property under the ``X/Y/Z Drive`` sections of the ``Rigidbody Launcher/Kinematic Rigidbody/Collision`` configurable joint.
  * Other properties of the joint on ``Collision`` are editable depending on the rigidbody motion you want to achieve.
* To launch the rigidbody perfectly straight, freeze rotation for XYZ on the ``Collision`` rigidbody (not the configurable joint), and set the X and Y motion on the ``Collision`` configurable joint as locked.
  * This will make it so only Z-axis motion is possible.
